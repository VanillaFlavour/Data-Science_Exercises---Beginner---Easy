# Data-Science_Exercises
Proposed exercises from Alura's data science course designed to strengthen practical skills and knowledge in data science.

I've selected some of my favorite exercises to solve and have saved them here for anyone interested in viewing my solutions. Additionally, this repository serves as a resource for future reference, if needed.
